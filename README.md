# COVID-19 Fake News Detection
## Description
This project is a Fake News Detection for the Machine Learning Course at Tehran-Polytechnic (AUT) University . The goal is classification task (real vs fake) and benchmark the annotated dataset with machine learning techniques.
Fake news and rumors are rampant on social media.We annotated dataset with four machine learning baselines - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We obtain the best performance of 93.46% F1-score with SVM.

## Challenge
This was a competition challenge based project arranged by CodaLab (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26655). The challenge was to build a system which can detect fake news based on given training dataset (which included tweets and comments from various social media users)
The following article is mainly used.

## Data 
(train, validation, test, test labels): 
[https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26655]

â€¢ Real- Tweets from verified sources and give useful information on COVID-19.

â€¢ Fake- Tweets, posts, articles which make claims and speculations about COVID-19 which are verified to be not true.
